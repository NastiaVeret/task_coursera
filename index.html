                <p>
                    Chickens come in various breeds, each with unique characteristics. They progress through different life stages, starting as eggs, hatching into chicks, and maturing into pullets (young hens) and cockerels (young roosters). Hens typically begin laying
                    eggs at around 5-6 months old, with egg production influenced by factors like breed and environment. Roosters, the male chickens, play a role in fertilizing eggs and exhibit behaviors like crowing to establish territory. Molting is
                    a natural process where chickens shed and regrow feathers, occurring annually and affecting egg production temporarily.</p>
